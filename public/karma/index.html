        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As the famous philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What Goes Around&hellip; Comes Around</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps, he is right.
There might even be something as ephemeral as <em>karma</em> in this ethereal world.
Anyway, my point is that life itself has a way of getting back to you.
Whatever you think you&rsquo;ve passed, whatever you&rsquo;ve thought you&rsquo;ve achieved,
whatever you think you&rsquo;ve let go&hellip; has a way of returning to you at a later point in life.
Seems absurd, but remains true.</p>
<p>With your new-found knowledge of life experience, might be that you&rsquo;ve come to like it.
What an extraordinary thing is this consciousness, I tell you, it&rsquo;s like water, ever flowing, ever-changing shape.</p>

<h3 id="my-hate-for-yoga">My hate for yoga</h3>
<p>Being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India">indian</a> abroad has certain perks,
but also has its own disadvantages.
I got raised with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga">Yoga</a> from a very young age.
I did not like it and was totally pushed into it.
I hated it so bad that i started doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate">Karate</a> instead.
I got to a brown belt which I was super proud of.</p>
<p>Pretty nice!
No one has the power to force things on me, I thought.
Life had other plans&hellip;</p>
