## Introduction

As the famous philosopher [Justin Timberlake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake) once said:
> What Goes Around... Comes Around

Perhaps, he is right.
There might even be something as ephemeral as _karma_ in this ethereal world.
Anyway, my point is that life itself has a way of getting back to you.
Whatever you think you've passed, whatever you've thought you've achieved,
whatever you think you've let go... has a way of returning to you at a later point in life.
Seems absurd, but remains true. 

With your new-found knowledge of life experience, might be that you've come to like it.
What an extraordinary thing is this consciousness, I tell you, it's like water, ever flowing, ever-changing shape.


## Three case studies


### My hate for yoga

Being an [indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India) abroad has certain perks,
but also has its own disadvantages.
I got raised with [Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga) from a very young age.
I did not like it and was totally pushed into it.
I hated it so bad that i started doing [Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate) instead.
I got to a brown belt which I was super proud of.

Pretty nice!
No one has the power to force things on me, I thought.
Life had other plans...


After moving to Amsterdam in the Netherlands - I started getting into bouldering alot as a way to destress and get awaya from the keyboard. Eventually, i also caught the climbing bug. As is the norm, i started plateauing at around 6b-6c ish for a very very long time. Seemed like so imposisble to breakthrough those grades. This is when i got to the better climbers and they had one word for me, Yoga. And surprisingly, It heelped. I was able to do a 7a in my life for the first time after using yoga as a way to restor and warm down. I am happy toreport that ive finally gotten the yoga bug and i love it so far


### My hate for programming

I got introduced into coding way early on. My neighbour was a computer science major in his universtih (he would go on to get a phd in computer systems or whatever i dont remembem anymore). So, as with all other thigns i was pushed at aroun 10 yrs or so into "computer class" for some reason. i had no idea what a programming language was at 10. lest, i didnt even understand english that well. shakespear made no sense to me when i was that age

so you have this and a higly formalised way of writing called the c programming language - this was the worst. i hated the blue screen, i hated the semicolons, i hated the curly braces. nothing made sense, you could just write a sentence in plane english. why tf was there this need to follow this extra difficult "english" that just prints some stuff onto the computer screen or adds some numbers. it made no sense to me whatsoever. from then on i had an aversion to being a software developer, or with computer people in general. i thought it was a waste of my time. i didnt enjoy it.


we had logo at school - somehow or the other i just vould do magic with that turtle in the moddle of the screen. compared to the textual c console, this was waay more fun and i excelled in computer scinece class at school. fast forward to high shool, where we had mysql and some kind of application building stuff called netbeans. again, this was a walk in the park. i eventually went on to top the school in our finals


fast fowrad to after me moing to the netherlands, i got super intered in modelling and computaitonal physivs. i did an introductory course in python and it was awesome. the teacher was a cool guy, and he was super inspuring. he got me into vim and git and all the necessary tools getting ready for being a siftware developer. i totally didnt have a clue then that these things would be immensly useful later. the mnist dataset was just published two years ago when i was still at the university. tihs was super nice. i was at the cutting edge of AI before i even knoew it. i did some introductory courses. my first ever linked in post was a text to speech model that i trained myself of 5 days on my laptop (link required). nowadays this can be done in an hour more or less maybe ? we have come far indeed.

this is exactly when the cambridge analytica scandal happened. i had a feeling that i had todo something about it. i knew the litrature, i have the math from my main study. im not getting any phd positions, thhen why not i thought. why not start a ompany that does that. my first ever startup Antai - which went bankrupt eventually. thats another story entirely


i realised programming is power. it feeds me. i can do stuff with it. i can make money with it. eventually with all things, i started to like it. not the programming that i was used to in acaddemia, but the actually software develop,met cicrles.

it is indeed baffiling and inspiring to hear the various trailblazing stories of all these enterpreneours. and how they continue to shape the world even today. i realised this thing i have is power.


a few years later....

here i am, when evey other thing in life is going to shit, the art of programming provies the necessarry respite. some level of control in this chaotic world. the solace of fixing some grevience, providing some value - fixing one thing at a time. it is fun.

in both these thigns i give you a personal example of how long held (dubious) beliefs breakdown and change. they change in accordance with my own self so to speak. 

this is a strange but refreshing. goes to show, nothing, i mean nothing - no belief system whatsoever is with its own persopective. i thought i hated these two things but these belifs have a "shelf life" sort of. updating onces ideas is therefore necessary. 

maybe we should all be sharks in the see of informaiton and belife systems. always keep moving, always re valuating the importanve of things. and how they are perceived by our own selves. 


just for the record, i dont listen to Justin timberlake anymore.
