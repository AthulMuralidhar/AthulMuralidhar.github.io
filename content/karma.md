## Introduction

As the famous philosopher [Justin Timberlake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake) once said:
> What Goes Around... Comes Around

Perhaps, he is right.
There might even be something as ephemeral as _karma_ in this ethereal world.
Anyway, my point is that life itself has a way of getting back to you.
Whatever you think you've passed, whatever you've thought you've achieved,
whatever you think you've let go... has a way of returning to you at a later point in life.
Seems absurd, but remains true. 

With your new-found knowledge of life experience, might be that you've come to like it.
What an extraordinary thing is this consciousness, I tell you, it's like water, ever flowing, ever-changing shape.


## Three case studies


### My hate for yoga

Being an [indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India) abroad has certain perks,
but also has its own disadvantages.
I got raised with [Yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga) from a very young age.
I did not like it and was totally pushed into it.
I hated it so bad that i started doing [Karate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate) instead.
I got to a brown belt which I was super proud of.

Pretty nice!
No one has the power to force things on me, I thought.
Life had other plans...
